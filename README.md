According to tne code in main1(is about part1)we saw that in the first fuction(T*) the time to add shapes is longer than the second function(T**). 
Result : we can use pointer-to-pointer(T**) to reduce clocks in such problems.
*main2 & main3 are about part2 :
In main2 we use inheritance but in the main3 we use composition.
When we have a "Has-a" relation, prefer the composition to inheritance.Composition gives us more flexibility and we can easily change the structor of the object.
("Has-a" relation means that one object contains another object...)
(I wanted to show this part(2) with both methods)
